    "The equations of the regression lines are given as:\n",
    "2X + 3 - 8 = 0   (1)\n",
    "2Y + X - 5 = 0   (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Variance of Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the variance of Y, we need to determine the coefficient of X in equation (2). From equation (2), we can see that the coefficient of X is 1. Therefore, the variance of Y is equal to the variance of X, which is given as 4.\n",
    "Variance of Y = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Coefficient of determination (R^2):\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination (R^2) is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data. It represents the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable (Y) that is explained by the independent variable (X).\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the coefficient of determination is:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = (SSR / SST)\n",
    "where SSR is the sum of squared residuals and SST is the total sum of squares.\n",
    "To calculate the coefficient of determination, we need to calculate SSR and SST.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR is the sum of squared residuals, which can be calculated using the regression equations and the given variance of X:\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR = Σ(y_predicted - y_actual)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values into equation (2):\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR = Σ((2Y + X - 5)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "SST is the total sum of squares, which is equal to the variance of Y multiplied by the number of observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "SST = Variance of Y * n\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "SST = 4 * n\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can calculate the coefficient of determination:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = SSR / SST\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Standard error of estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of estimate represents the average distance between the actual values and the predicted values from the regression line. It is a measure of the accuracy of the regression model.\n",
    "To calculate the standard error of estimate for X on Y and Y on X, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the residuals. The standard deviation of the residuals can be obtained by taking the square root of the mean squared residual (MSR).\n",
    "Standard error of estimate = √MSR\n",
    "To calculate MSR, we need to calculate the sum of squared residuals (SSR) and divide it by the degrees of freedom (df), which is equal to the number of observations minus the number of independent variables.\n",
    "MSR = SSR / df\n",
    "For X on Y:\n",
    "df_XonY = n - 1\n",
    "For Y on X:\n",
    "df_YonX = n - 2\n",
    "Substituting the values and calculating the standard error of estimate for both X on Y and Y on X.\n",
    "Please provide the value of 'n' (number of observations) to proceed with the calculations."
