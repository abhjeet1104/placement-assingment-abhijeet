    "a. To conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups (Group A and Group B), we can use a two-sample independent t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group A: Mean improvement score (µA) = 2.5, Standard deviation (σA) = 0.8, Sample size (nA) = 30\n",
    "Group B: Mean improvement score (µB) = 2.2, Standard deviation (σB) = 0.6, Sample size (nB) = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula for the two-sample independent t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (µA - µB) / sqrt((σA^2/nA) + (σB^2/nB))\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the given values:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (2.5 - 2.2) / sqrt((0.8^2/30) + (0.6^2/30))\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the value of t:\n",
    "\n",
    "t = 0.3 / sqrt((0.0173) + (0.012))\n",
    "\n",
    "b. The critical value for a significance level of 0.05 with (nA + nB - 2) degrees of freedom is obtained from a t-distribution table. Let's assume it to be tcrit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calculated value of t is greater than tcrit or falls in the critical region (t > tcrit), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. Otherwise, if the calculated value of t is less than tcrit (t < tcrit), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have the exact values, we cannot determine the outcome of the t-test without knowing the critical value or degrees of freedom. However, based on the given data and assuming that the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, we can state that there is evidence to suggest a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between Group A and Group B.\n"
