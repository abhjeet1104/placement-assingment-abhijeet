    "To test the hypothesis that the mean scores of all the students are the same, we can use a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean scores of all the students are equal, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that at least one mean score is different.\n",
